Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a graduate student at Northwestern University pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2024 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in automation and robotics. During my years in undergrad, I was fortunate to work on a variety of projects in the areas of robotics, mechatronics, and controls through coursework and internships that helped me develop a passion for robotics.
<br>
<br>
Outside of robotics, I enjoy watching sports, listening to music, and spending time with friends playing sports and games like pickleball, tennis, ping pong, and cornhole.
