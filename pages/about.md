Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am currently working as a Robotics Engineer at Southwest Research Institute where I work on both hardware and software for robotic solutions. Prior to this role, I earned an MS in Robotics at Northwestern University in December 2025 and earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2024.
<br>
<br>
Outside of robotics, I enjoy watching sports, listening to music, and spending time with friends playing sports and games like pickleball, tennis, ping pong, and cornhole.
