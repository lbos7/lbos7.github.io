# Propeller-Driven Balance Beam
The goal of this project was to design a CAD model of a system with complex geometry using solid and surface modeling techniques. Components of this model were then used to perform a structural FEA simulation.

## Overview
For a final project in the Georgia Institute of Technology's ME 4042: Interactive CAD and FEA, my group decided on designing a road bike and performing a structural analysis to see how it deforms under a rider's weight. The completed assembly is shown below.

## My Focus
In this project I was in charge of modeling everything besides the wheel and pedal assemblies and perfoming the FEA simulations on the bike frame and fork.
<br>

## Modeling
I used solid and surface modeling techniques to create my assigned parts. The most difficult part for me to make was the bike frame due to its complex geometry, which consisted of many surfaces. The assembly of my assigned parts is shown below.
