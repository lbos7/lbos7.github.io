# KUKA youBot Pick & Place
The goal of this project was to implement concepts of robotic manipulation such as screw theory, motion planning, trajectory generation, and control through simulation of a pick and place task using a KUKA youBot in CoppeliaSim.

## Overview
This project was divided into 3 main stages - youBot kinematics, end-effector reference trajectory generation, and controls. Once each stage was completed, a script was written to generate csv files with 13 elements in each line to run the simulation in CoppeliaSim.
